# Third-party extensions

Third-party extensions are developed and maintained outside of the mkdocstrings organization, by various developers. They generally bring support for third-party libraries.

Available third-party extensions:

- [`docstring-inheritance`](third-party/docstring-inheritance.md): A more advanced docstring inheritance utility that also provides a Griffe extension.
- [`fieldz`](third-party/fieldz.md): Support for data-class like objects (dataclasses, pydantic, attrs, etc.) using [fieldz](https://github.com/pyapp-kit/fieldz).
- [`generics`](third-party/generics.md): Resolve generic type parameters as bound types in subclasses.
- [`inherited-method-crossrefs`](third-party/inherited-method-crossrefs.md): Replace docstrings of inherited methods with cross-references to parents.
- [`modernized-annotations`](third-party/modernized-annotations.md): Modernize type annotations by adopting PEP 585 and PEP 604.

You can find more third-party extensions by exploring the [`griffe-extension` topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/griffe-extension). You can also check out the "in-project" extensions (not published to PyPI) used in various projects on GitHub by [searching for "griffe extension" in code](https://github.com/search?q=griffe+Extension+language%3Apython&type=code).
