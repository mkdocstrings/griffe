`docstring-inheritance` is a Python package that allows to avoid writing and maintaining duplicated Python docstrings. The typical usage is to enable the inheritance of the docstrings from a base class such that its derived classes fully or partially inherit the docstrings. It provides a Griffe extension and recommends to use it alongside the official [`inherited-docstrings`](../../official/inherited-docstrings/) extension in MkDocs:

```
plugins:
- mkdocstrings:
    handlers:
      python:
        options:
          extensions:
          - griffe_inherited_docstrings
          - docstring_inheritance.griffe

```
