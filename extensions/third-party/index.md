# Third-party extensions

Third-party extensions are developed and maintained outside of the mkdocstrings organization, by various developers. They generally bring support for third-party libraries.

| [`docstring-inheritance`](docstring-inheritance/)           | A more advanced docstring inheritance utility that also provides a Griffe extension.                                          |

| [`generics`](generics/)                                     | Resolve generic type parameters as bound types in subclasses.                                                                 |

You can find more third-party extensions by exploring the [`griffe-extension` topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/griffe-extension). You can also check out the "in-project" extensions (not published to PyPI) used in various projects on GitHub by [searching for "griffe extension" in code](https://github.com/search?q=griffe+Extension+language%3Apython&type=code).
