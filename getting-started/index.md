# Getting started

To begin using Griffe, refer to [Installation](../installation/) and take a look at our [short introduction](../introduction/). If you'd like to experiment with Griffe without installing it, try our [playground](../playground/) directly in your browser.

If you have questions, need help, or want to contribute, feel free to reach out to the community! You can open [new discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe/discussions) or join our [Gitter channel](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#mkdocstrings_griffe:gitter.im) for a quick chat.
